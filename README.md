# Implementations of some standard Image Processing Algos using OPENCV

#### What the files do ->
* Blue an input image using opencv
* Crop an image using opencv mouse callbacks
* doc_scanner lets you crop a document according your needs and then convert it into a "top view", even if the photo was taken from a different angle
* draw basic images in opencv
* lane_detection using hough transform to detect lines
* Implementation of the dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path to a destination for the robot
* Implementation of the A Star algorithm to find the shortest path to a destination for the robot
* Track an object usign color thresholding in opencv
